# GitHub-tools

## What is GitHub-tools ?
Github tools is a simple chrome extension adding information concerning each PR in GitHub's Pull Requests list.

While developing, it's common to have a lot of PR's opened, and seeing list to wonder "Oh, did I already reviewed this one ? Or maybe the others reviewed it and they're standing for me to merge..." Forget it :)

GitHub-tools rely on GitHub's API to check this for you and display who reviewed and approved or requested changes, highlighting your name if you appear on reviews.

## How to use
Provide a to [GitHub personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` rights, check that the user is correctly recognized and then forget about it.

Now when you are on a GitHub PR page, you will see additional information.
